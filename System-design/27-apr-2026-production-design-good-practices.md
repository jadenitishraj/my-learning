|   |       |-- Is it observable?
|   |       |-- Is it recoverable?
|   |       |-- Is it evolvable?
|   |
|   |-- Key Properties
|       |-- Observability → detect issues
|       |-- Recoverability → fix failures quickly
|       |-- Evolvability → change without breakage
|
|-- Core Production Constraints
|   |-- Availability (SLA)
|   |   |-- 99% → 3.65 days/year
|   |   |-- 99.9% → 8.76 hours/year
|   |   |-- 99.99% → 52 minutes/year
|   |   |-- 99.999% → ~5 minutes/year
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Insight
|   |   |   |-- Each “9” ≈ 10x improvement
|   |   |   |-- Requires exponential effort
|   |   |
|   |   |-- Multi-component Availability
|   |   |   |-- Product of dependencies
|   |   |   |-- Weakest link dominates
|   |   |

|   |       |-- Read replicas
|   |       |-- Circuit breakers
|   |       |-- Graceful degradation
|   |
|   |-- Latency Budget

|   |   |
|   |   |-- Budget Allocation
|   |   |   |-- Network → ~50ms
|   |   |   |-- Load balancer → ~5ms

    |   |-- ~1M users
    |   |-- 30+ services
    |   |-- 99.99% SLA
    |
    |-- Design Principle
    |   |-- Build for next 10x (not 100x)
    |
    |-- Re-architecture Signals
        |-- Deployment delays (>2 days)
        |-- Frequent incidents (>2/month)
        |-- Latency near SLA limit (80%)
